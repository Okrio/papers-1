However, this room simulator still has its limitations.  It assumes that all the microphones are ideal, which means that they all have zero-phase all-pass responses. Even though this assumption is very convenient, it is not true with actual microphones due to microphone spectrum distortion. In addition, there might be other distortion factors such as electrical noise in the circuit, acoustic auralization effect from the surface of the hardware, and various vibrations.  In the conventional MTR, we usually add additive noise and reverberation effects to the training set. However we do not usually model the spectral or phase distortion across different filter bank or microphone channels. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which adds phase distortion to make phase-sensitive deep learning model more robust.
