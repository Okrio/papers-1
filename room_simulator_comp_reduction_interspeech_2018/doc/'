% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.



% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present a new dereverberation algorithm 
called Temporal Masking and Thresholding
(TMT) to enhance the temporal spectral of spectral features
for robust speech recognition under reverberant environments.
This algorithm is motivated by the precedence effects and
temporal masking of human auditory perception. 
This work is an improvement of our previous dereverberation
work called Suppression of Slowly-varying components and
the falling edge of the power envelope (SSF). In TMT
algorithm compared to SSF, we use a different mathematical
model to model the temporal masking and thresholding.
Speech recognition results show that TMT algorithm is 
superior to other algorithms such as LTLSS, VTS, or SSF
for reverberation.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} recent years, advances in machine learning
techniques such as Deep Neural Network TODO(chanwcom) 
%cite DNN papers
and enhanced computational power TODO(chanwcom) 
%cite GPU papers
have greatly improved the performance of speech recognition systems
especially in clean environments. Nevertheless, the performance
under noisy environments still needs to be significantly improved
to be useful for far-field speech recognition applications.

Thus far, many researchers have proposed various kinds of algorithms
to address this problem (\emph{e.g.} \cite{P_J_Moreno_ICASSP_1996,
R_M_Stern_ETRW_1997, C_Kim_ASRU_2009_2, C_Kim_ICASSP_2012_1,
C_Kim_ICASSP_2012_2}). To some degrees, these efforts have been
successful for the near-field additive noise, however,
for far-field reverberant speech, the same algorithms usually
haven't shown the same amount of improvement.

Many hearing researchers believe that human perception in 
reverberation is enabled by ``precedence effect", which refers to
an emphasis that appears to be given to the first-arriving
wave-front of a complex signal in sound localization and
possibly speech perception (\emph{e.g.} 
\cite{P_M_Zurek_DirectionalHearing_SpringerVerlag_1987}).
To detect the first wave-front, we can either measure the
envelope of the signal or energy in the frame (\emph{e.g.}
\cite{K_D_Martin_ASPAA_1997, Y_Park_IEICE_ElectronicsExpress_2008})


Motivated by this, in our previous work, we introduced 
an algorithm called Suppression of Slowly varying-components and the Falling
edge of the power envelope (SSF) to enhance speech recognition
accuracy under reverberant environments \cite{C_Kim_INTERSPEECH_2010_2}.
This algorithm has been especially successful for reverberation, but
the processing introduces distortion in the resynthesized speech.
The nonlinear high-pass filtering in \cite{C_Kim_INTERSPEECH_2010_2}
is an effective model to detect the first-arriving wavefront, but
it might not be very close to how actual human beings perceive
sound.

In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm named Temporal
Masking and Thresholding (TMT). In this algorithm,
temporal masks are constructed to suppress reflected wave files
under reverberant environments. We estimate the perceived 
peak sound level after applying the power-law nonlinearity,
and apply a temporal masking based on this. We also apply 
thresholding based on the peak power.

However, in the real situations, even if the target is located along
the perpendicular bisector of the line connecting two microphones,
the phase difference would not be zero. 
Even if two microphones are of the same model, these real two microphones
are not exactly identical in physical characteristics, and
the recording circuity may also add some non-uniform delay.

\subsection{No smoothing vs rectangular vs gammatone smoothing}

TODO(chanwcom) Modify the following sentence.
Let's do the experiments with the following configuration.

In our previous research, it has been frequently observed that

\begin{itemize}
  \item compensation for each frequency index
  \item compensation using the rectangular frequency response
  \item compensation using the gammatone-shape frequency response
\end{itemize}

The advantage of the rectangular frequency response over the
gammatone-shape frequency response is the rectangular frequency response
approach is simpler, and requires less computation for frequency domain


TODO(chanwcom)
Explanation about the gammatone weighting.

The advantage of the rectangular smoothing is computational cost
is significantly less

TODO(chanwcom) Also look at some of my previous papers.

Let $x_0[n]$ and $x_1[n]$ represent signals from the left and right
microphones, respectively. To represent the narrowband short-time signals,
we use the symbols $x_0[n; m, \omega_k]$ and 
$x_1[n; m, \omega_k]$, respectively, where $m$ is the frame index,
and $\omega_k$ is the discrete-time frequency defined by 
$\omega_k = \frac{2 \pi k}{N}, 0 \le k \le N - 1$. These signals are
narrowband signals centered at frequency $\omega_k$.



Suppose that we have signals from a pair of microphones represented by
$X_0[m, e^{j \omega_k})$ and $X_1[m, e^{j \omega_k})$.
Suppose that we have signals the two microphones represented by
$x_0[n]$ and $x_1[n]$. By applying successive Hamming windows to the
speech signals, we obtain the Short-Time Fouer
TODO(chanwcom) citing the SMAD paper, and also all of my previous papers
Suppose that $X_0[m, e^{j \omega_k})$ and $X_1[m, e^{j \omega_k})$.
We refer to $\tau[m, e^{j \omega_k})$ as the ITD at frame index at $m$
and frequency $\omega_k$. Then
Suppose that 


As the simplest case, suppose that we have two signals 
$x_0[n; m, \omega_k)$ and
$x_1[n; m, \omega_k)$. 
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_0[n; m, \omega_k] = x_1[n - \tau[m, \omega_k); m, \omega_k]
    \label{eq:two_mic_signals_time_domain}
\end{eqnarray}
Performing the Fourier transform of \eqref{eq:two_mic_signals_time_domain},
 we obtain the following relation:
\begin{eqnarray}
  X_0[m, e^{j \omega_k})
      = e^{-j \omega_k \tau[m, \omega_k)} X_1[m; e^{j \omega_k})
    \label{eq:two_mic_signals_freq_domain}
\end{eqnarray}
%
From \eqref{eq:two_mic_signals_freq_domain}, we find that the phase
difference between two spectra is given by the following equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Delta \phi[m, e^{j \omega_k}) & = & \angle{X_L[m, e^{j \omega_k})}
      - \angle{X_R[m, e^{j \omega_k})} \nonumber \\
               & = & \omega_k \tau[m, e^{j \omega_k})  + 2 \pi l
\end{eqnarray}
where $l$ is an integer.

We define $\phi_{\tau}[m, e^{j \omega_k})$ as follows \cite{C_Kim_ICASSP_2012_2}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \phi_{\tau}[m, e^{j \omega_k}) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \Delta \phi[m, e^{j \omega_k}),   \\
            \qquad \text{if } \big| \Delta \phi[m, e^{j \omega_k}) \big|
                \le \pi  \\
        \Delta \phi[m, e^{j \omega_k}) - 2 \pi,    \\
            \qquad \text{if } \Delta \phi[m, e^{j \omega_k}) 
                \ge \pi  \\
        \Delta \phi[m, e^{j \omega_k}) + 2 \pi,    \\
              \qquad \text{if } \Delta \phi[m, e^{j \omega_k})  \le -\pi 
    \end{cases}  
\end{eqnarray}

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:two_mics_block_diagram},
if the sound source is located along a line of angle 
$\theta[m, \omega_k)$, with respect to the perpendicular 
bisector to the line between two
 microphones, geometric consideration determine the ITD in the
discrete-time domain $\tau[m, \omega_k)$ to be 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \tau[m, \omega_k) 
      = \frac{d \sin \left( \theta[m, \omega_k )  \right) f_s}
          {c_{air}}
\end{eqnarray}


The above relation may be simplified using the modular operation:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \phi_{\tau}[m, \omega_k) 
      = \left[\left(
          \Delta \phi[m, e^{j \omega_k}) + \pi\right) \mod 2 \pi \right]
              - \pi
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mod$ is a modulo operation.

The relationship between $\theta$ and $\phi$ is given as 
follows \cite{C_Kim_ICASSP_2012_2}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \theta[m, e^{j \omega_k}) = \sin^{(-1)} 
      \left(  
          \frac{c_{air} \phi_{\tau}[m, e^{j \omega_k})}{\omega_k f_s d} 
              \right)
\end{eqnarray}
where $c_{air}$ is the speed of the sound air (assumed to be 343.0 $m/s$ 
in our work) and $f_s$ is the sampling rate, and $d$ is the distance 
between two microphones. In our work, we used the distance of 
$d = 0.02 \, m$.

\subsection{Search for the offset angle}

TODO(chanwcom) Adding a figure when smoothing is not performed.
In this section, we describe how to estimate the phase offset 
$\theta_o(\omega_k)$ at the frequency $\omega_k$.
For each channel $l$, we collect the following data:
$\phi[m, e^{j \omega_k}), $.
For each frequency component we apply weighted averaging.

Many researchers have tried to describe how the physical 
frequency of an incoming signal is related to the representation 
of that frequency by the human auditory system.  
As one of such works, Moore and Glasberg \cite{B_C_J_Moore_ActaAcustica_1996}, 
proposed the Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) scale modifying Zwicker’s loudness model. 
The ERB scale is a measure that gives
an approximation to the bandwidth of filters in human hearing using 
rectangular bandpass filters; several different approximations of 
the ERB scale exist. The following relation is used in our work
to relate the frequency $f$ in $Hz$ with the ERB rate scale $r$
 \cite{M_Brookes_VoiceBox}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  r & = & \text{ERBS}(f) \nonumber  \\
    & = & 11.17268 \ln\left(1 + \frac{46.06538 f}{f + 14678.49} \right) \\
  f & = & \text{ERBS}^{-1}(r) \nonumber \\
    & = & \frac{676170.4}{47.06538-\exp\left(0.08950404 - r \right)} \nonumber \\ 
    &   &   - 14678.49 
\end{eqnarray}
where $f$ is the frequency in $kHz$. Fig. \ref{fig:plot_freq_vs_erb} shows the relation
between the frequency and the ERB scale.

\begin{eqnarray}
  \Phi = \left\{ \phi \Big| \phi_t - \frac{\phi_w}{2}  \le \phi \le \phi_t + \frac{\phi_w}{2} \right\}
\end{eqnarray}
We convert the linear frequency into the Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth
(ERB) scale, 


We define the following terms:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \psi[m, e^{j\omega_k}) & = &
        \mathds{1}_{\Phi} 
        (\phi[m, e^{j\omega_k'}]) \big|X_A[m,  e^{j\omega_k'})\big|^ 2 \nonumber \\
                         & &   \times  \phi[m, e^{j\omega_k'}] \\
  \xi[m, e^{j\omega_k}) & = &
        \mathds{1}_{\Phi}(\phi[m, e^{j\omega_k'}])
            \big|X_A[m,  e^{j\omega_k'})\big|^2
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathds{1}()$ is the indicator function.

\begin{eqnarray}
  \phi_o(\omega_k) = 
      \frac{
          \sum_{m = 0} ^ {M - 1} 
              \sum_{k' = g\left(l\left(\omega_k\right)\right)}
                  ^{g\left(u(\omega_k)\right)} 
                      \psi[m, e^{j\omega_k})
            }
            {
              \sum_{m = 0} ^ {M - 1} 
                  \sum_{k' = g\left(l\left(\omega_k\right)\right)}
                      ^{g\left(u(\omega_k)\right)} 
                          \xi[m, e^{j\omega_k})
            }
\end{eqnarray}
where $l(\omega_k)$ is defined as follows: 
\begin{eqnarray}
  l(\omega_k) = \frac{2 \pi}{f_s} \text{ERBS}^{-1}
      \left(\max\left\{r(\omega_k) - \frac{b}{2}, 0 \right\}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where $r$ is defined by:
\begin{eqnarray}
  r(\omega_k) = \text{ERBS} \left(\frac{\omega_k}{2 \pi} f_s\right) 
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly, $u(\omega_k)$ are defined as follows: 
\begin{eqnarray}
  u(\omega_k) = \frac{2 \pi}{f_s} \text{ERBS}^{-1}
      \left(r(\omega_k) + b \right)
\end{eqnarray}
$g(\omega)$ is a function to obtain the discrete frequency index $k$
from the discrete-time frequency $\omega$. Since the relation is given by
$\omega = \frac{2 \pi k}{N}$, $g(\omega)$ is defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
  k = g(\omega) = \left\lceil\frac{\omega N}{2 \pi} + 0.5\right\rceil
\end{eqnarray}
where $N$ is the FFT size.
Usually, the phase offset is a function of the frequency $\omega_k$,
thus we represent it by $\theta_o(l)$. 

TODO(chanwcom) Mentioning the SMAD paper
where $X_A[m, e^{j \omega_k}]$ is the average of the spectra
from the left and right microphones defined by:
\begin{eqnarray}
  X_A[m, e^{j \omega_k}) = \frac{X_R[m, e^{j \omega_k}) + X_L[m, e^{j \omega_k})}{2}
\end{eqnarray}


For each channel $l$, we calculate the following power:

In this section, we discuss how to estimate the offset value. For
a certain channel $l$, suppose that the offset is 
We consider the following bin $[\theta - \theta_0, \theta + \theta_0]$.

\section{Structure of POC processing}
\label{sec:structure_of_TMT_processing}

Figure \ref{fig:TMT_block_diagram} shows the entire structure of 
TMT processing. In the discussion below, we assume that the
sampling rate of the speech signal is 16 {\it kHz}, however this algorithm
may be applied for other sampling rates as well.
%
%
TODO(chanwcom) % Obtain the optimal frame length by experiments.
Speech is segmented into 100 ms frames with 10 ms intervals between
adjacent frames. A Hamming window is applied for each frame, and
Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) is performed. 
Spectral power in 40 analysis bands is obtained. Temporal masking
and thresholding are performed for each channel, and the speech
spectrum is reshaped based on these processing. Finally, the
output speech is resynthesized using the IFFT and the OverLap Addition
(OLA) method. The following subsections describe each stage in more detail.

\subsection{Gammatone frequency integration and auditory nonlinearity}
%
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:TMT_block_diagram}, the first step
of TMT processing is performing Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) using
Hamming windows of duration 100 ms. We use this medium-duration window 
which is longer than those used in ordinary speech processing, since 
it has been frequently observed that medium-duration windows are better
suited for noise suppression \cite{C_Kim_INTERSPEECH_2009_1, 
C_Kim_ASRU_2009_1}.
%
%
TODO(chanwcom) % Check what would be a good window length.
 As in \cite{C_Kim_IEEETran_2014_1}, the gammatone spectral integration
is done by the following equation:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  P[m, l] = \sum_{k = 0}^{K / 2}
      \Big| X[m, e^{j \omega_k}] H_l(e^{j \omega_k}) \Big|^2  
          \label{eq:spectral_integration}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $K$ is the DFT size, $m$ and $l$ represent the frame and
channel indices respectively. $\omega_k$ is a discrete-frequency
defined by $\omega_k = \frac{2 \pi k}{K}$, and $H_l(e^{j \omega_k})$
is the gammatone response for the $l$-th channel. $P[m, l]$ is the
power obtained for the time-frequency bin $[m, l]$.

The gammatone responses $H_l(e^{j \omega_k})$ are slightly different
from those used in our previous research in \cite{C_Kim_IEEETran_2014_1,
C_Kim_ASRU_2009_2}. The frequency responses are modified to satisfy
the following constraint:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \sum_{l = 0}^{L - 1} H(e^{j \omega_k}) = 1.  \label{eq:unity_constraint}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $L$ is the number of the gammatone channels. The reason for this
constraint will be explained in Sec. \ref{sec:spectral_reshaping}.
Even though frequency responses $Q_l(e^{j \omega_k})$ of an ordinary 
filter bank usually do not satisfy \eqref{eq:unity_constraint}, we may 
normalize the filter response to make them satisfy 
\eqref{eq:unity_constraint} by normalizing them as follows:
%
\begin{eqnarray} 
    H_l(e^{j\omega_k}) = \frac{\big|Q_l(e^{j\omega_k}) \big|}
        {\sum_{l = 0}^{L - 1} \big| Q_l(e^{j\omega_k}) \big|}.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Since the power $P[m, l]$ in \eqref{eq:spectral_integration} is not
directly related to how human beings perceive the sound level, we
apply the power function based nonlinearity \cite{C_Kim_PhDThesis,
C_Kim_IEEETran_2014_1}.
\begin{eqnarray}
  S[m, l] = P[m, l]^{a_0}     \label{eq:compressive_nonlinearity}  
\end{eqnarray}
As in \cite{C_Kim_IEEETran_2014_1, C_Kim_INTERSPEECH_2010_1, 
C_Kim_ICASSP_2010_1}, 
we use the power coefficient of $a_0 = \frac{1}{15}$.

\subsection{Peak sound level estimation and binary mask generation}
\label{sec:peak_sound_level_estimation}

From $S[m, l]$, we obtain the peak sound level for each channel
$l$. The peak sound level is the upper envelope of the $S[m, l]$
as shown in Fig. TODO(chanwcom) XXX. We use the following simple
mathematical model.
\begin{eqnarray}
  T[m, l] = \max(\lambda T[m - 1, l], S[m, l]) 
\end{eqnarray}
Using the peak sound level $T[m, l]$, the binary mask $\mu[m, l]$ 
is constructed using the following criterion:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \mu[m, l] = 
  \begin{cases}
      1, \qquad \text{if } S[m, l] \ge T[m, l]  \\
      0, \qquad \text{if } S[m, l] < T[m, l].
        \label{eq:binary_masking_coeff}
  \end{cases} 
\end{eqnarray}
In our previous SSF algorithm \cite{C_Kim_INTERSPEECH_2010_2}, we
used the 1st-order IIR lowpass filter output for a similar purpose,
but in this work, we use a model more closely related to human 
perception.
In binary masking, it has been frequently observed that 
a suitable flooring is necessary (\emph{e.g.}\cite{C_Kim_INTERSPEECH_2009_1, 
C_Kim_ICASSP_2012_2}). In many previous approaches, usually
fixed multiplier values like 0.01, or 0.001 were used for masked
time-frequency bins to prevent them from having zero power 
(\emph{e.g.} \cite{C_Kim_INTERSPEECH_2009_1}). 
In TMT algorithm, instead of using such scaling constants, we use a 
a threshold power level $\rho[m, l]$, which depends on the peak sound
level $T[m, l]$ for each time-frequency bin:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \rho[m, l] = \rho_0 {T[m, l]}^{\frac{1}{a_0}}
            \label{eq:flooring_level}
\end{eqnarray}
where $a_0$ is the power coefficient for the compressive nonlinearty 
in \eqref{eq:compressive_nonlinearity}. Since the compressive nonlineary
is expanded in \eqref{eq:flooring_level}, it is evident that the 
threshold power level $\rho[m, l]$ is 30 dB below the time-varying 
peak power. 
This thresholding scheme is also motivated by human auditory masking
effect.
We believe this thresholding approach is closer to the actual human
perception rather than just using some fixed constants like 0.01. 

The final masking coefficients $\mu_f[m, l]$ are obtained using
the threshold level $\rho[m, l]$ as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mu_f[m, l] = \max \left(\mu[m, l], \frac{\rho[m, l]}{P[m, l]}  \right).
\end{eqnarray}
where $P[m, l]$ is the power in the time-frequency bin $[m, l]$ in 
\eqref{eq:spectral_integration}.

%
%
%
\subsection{Spectral reshaping}
  \label{sec:spectral_reshaping}
%
Using the $\mu[m, l]$ masking coefficients obtained in 
\eqref{eq:binary_masking_coeff}, we obtain the enhanced spectrum 
$Y[m, l]$ using the spectral reshaping technique 
\cite{C_Kim_ASRU_2009_2, C_Kim_INTERSPEECH_2010_2}. 
\begin{eqnarray}
  Y[m, e^{j \omega_k}) = \sum_{l = 0}^{L - 1} 
      \left( \sqrt{\mu_f[m, l]} X[m, e^{j \omega_k})
           H_l(e^{j \omega_k}) \right)  
              \label{eq:spectral_reshaping}
\end{eqnarray}
We square rooted the floored masking coefficient $\mu_f[m, l]$ in
the above equation, because, the masking coefficients in Sec.
\ref{sec:peak_sound_level_estimation} is defined for power.
Now, it is time to discuss why the unity constraint in 
\eqref{eq:unity_constraint} needs to hold for the frequency 
responses.
In \eqref{eq:spectral_reshaping}, if $\mu_f[m, l] = 1$ for 
all $0 \le l \le L - 1$ at a certain frame $m$, then we expect
the output $Y[m, e^{j \omega_k})$ to be the same as the input
$X[m, e^{j \omega_k})$. From this, it is obvious that the 
filter bank needs to satisfy \eqref{eq:unity_constraint}. 
As before, $m$ and $l$ are the frame and channel indices, and $L$ is the
number of channels.  After obtaining the enhanced spectrum $Y[m, l]$, 
the output speech is resynthesized using the IFFT and the OverLap 
Addition (OLA).

In Fig. \label{fig:comparisons_of_spectrograms}, we compare the
spectrograms obtained from the original clean speech 
(Fig. \ref{fig:clean_speech_spectrogram}),
from the reverberant speech
(Fig. \ref{fig:reverb_speech_spectrogram}), and
the same reverberant speech when processed with this TMT processing
(Fig. \ref{fig:tmt_reverb_speech_spectrogram}). The reverberation
time ($T_{60}$) is 500 {\it ms}. As can clearly seen in these figures,
TMT processing has the effect of keeping the first arriving wavefront
and suppressing the following reflected waves.

In this paper, we describe a new dereverberation algorithm,
TMT, that is based on temporal enhancement by estimating the

is simple, but has shown better speech recognition accuracies
than existing algorithms like LTLSS or VTS. The matlab code
