There are eight audio files in this directory.

  * Single channel audio files
    - single_speaker_mono.wav
    - two_speakers_mono.wav 

  * Single channel audio files with reverberation
    - single_speaker_mono_rev_0p2.wav
    - two_speakers_mono_rev_0p2.wav

  * Two-channel audio files
    - single_speaker_stereo.wav
    - two_speakers_stereo.wav

  * Two-channel audio files with 0.2 seconds reverberation.
    - single_speaker_stereo_rev_0p2.wav
    - two_speakers_stereo_rev_0p2.wav

For single-speaker audio files, we use the following utterances from
the DARAPA Resource Management 1 (RM1) database.

  * aem0_2/sb06.wav from the RM1 database.

For two-speaker audio files, we use the following two audio files.
  * aem0_2/sb06.wav from the RM1 database.
  * TEST/DR1/FAKS0/SA1.WAV from the TIMIT database.
For these two-speaker audio files, the power of each speaker is the same,
which means that the SNR is zero dB. 
For reverberation simulation, we use the room simulator.

The protocol buffers for each configuration is as follows:

blaze run speech/dsp/room_acoustics_simulation:single_wav_room_acoustics_simulation  -- \
    --input_signal_wave_file=$input_wav_file  \
    --input_noise_sources_wave_file=$noise_wav_file  \
    --input_room_acoustics_params_file=$params_file  \
    --output_simulated_microphone_signals_file=$output_wav_file
