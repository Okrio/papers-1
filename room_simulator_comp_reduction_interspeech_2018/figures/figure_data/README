The sampling frequency is 16 kHz. Note that the source elevation w.r.t the
camera is fixed at 90 degrees (horizontal) for these RIRs.

Each RIR wav file has the following naming format:
<dist>_<azimuth>_<elevation>_rir_<room type>_<sampling frequency>.wav
dist (meters): distance of sound source from device
azimuth (degrees): 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees correspond to DOA from the right,
front, left, and rear of camera, respectively
elevation (degrees): 0, 90, 180 correspond to DOA from the top, horizontal, and
bottom of camera, respectively


TODO(chanwcom) What is the original directory location?
TODO(chanwcom) Makes a program to check the validity of each wavefiles
