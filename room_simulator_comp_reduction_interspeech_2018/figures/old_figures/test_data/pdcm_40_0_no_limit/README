1. Copy your matlab codes under $OCTAVE_WORK.
  cp $your_code $OCTAVE_WORK/

2. Run "copy_matlab_lib_here.pl"
  This command needs to be run on the directory where the main matlab function resides.
  copy_matlab_lib_here.pl
  This will copy set_path.m and matlab_lib to the current directory.

3. Add set_path right after the function definition.

4. Run with some samples to check whether the result is expected.
