The following is my personal journal template. 
It is using the IEEE template, which is avaialbe at
http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/authors/author_templates.html

1. Directory Structure
The directory structue is as folllows:

doc
figures
program

2. Bibliograpy

It does not include the bibliography directory, because it is assumed
that different paper templates share one common bibliography file.
